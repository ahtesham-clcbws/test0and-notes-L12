# Walkthrough: Student Portal Deep Analysis

## Objective
Perform a deep analysis of the student portal, focusing on the dashboard, test-taking, and package management features.

## Work Accomplished
- **Research**:
  - Analyzed `App\Livewire\Frontend\Auth\Register` for registration context.
  - Analyzed `DashboardController`, `ExamsController`, and `StudentPlanController` for core logic.
  - Analyzed related views and Blade templates for the frontend experience.
  - Reviewed `TestModal`, `UserDetails`, and `Educationtype` models for data structures.
- **Documentation**:
  - Created [student_portal_analysis.md](file:///i:/test-and-notes-upgrading/.agent/student_portal_analysis.md) with detailed structural insights and an architecture map.
  - Updated [task.md](file:///i:/test-and-notes-upgrading/.agent/task.md) to track all research steps.

## System Intelligence Initialization
The `.agent` folder has been established as the central repository for workspace intelligence, and the student portal context is now fully synchronized.

## Key Features Analyzed
1. **Dynamic Dashboard**: Activity tracking and material browsing based on student profile.
2. **End-to-End Testing**: From preparation to attempt and result viewing.
3. **Store & Subscriptions**: Razorpay integration and package content management.
